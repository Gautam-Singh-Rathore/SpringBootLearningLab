   - Distributed Databases (Cassandra, DynamoDB)  
   - Content Delivery Networks (CDN)  

✅ **Fault-Tolerant Designs**  
   - Replication & Redundancy  
   - Leader Election (Zookeeper)  

✅ **Event-Driven Architectures**  
   - Kafka Event Streams  
   - CQRS & Event Sourcing  

### **7️⃣ Case Studies (How Real Systems Work)**  
🔹 **YouTube** – Video streaming architecture

🔹 OpenAPI & Swagger Documentation  
🔹 Request Validation & Error Handling  
🔹 Versioning & Pagination  

### **4️⃣ Database Schema Design**  
✅ **Normalization & Indexing**  
   - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF  
   - Indexing Strategies  

✅ **Data Modeling for Real-World Applications**  
   - E-Commerce System  
   - Social Media Network  

### **5️⃣ Advanced LLD Concepts**

## **🚀 How to Follow This Roadmap Efficiently?**
1. **Start with HLD basics** and understand how large systems are structured.  
2. **Practice designing systems** (draw architecture diagrams, list down components).  
3. **Move to LLD** and learn object-oriented programming (OOP).  
4. **Practice implementing real-world systems** (URL shortener, ride-booking system, etc.).  
5. **Solve real interview questions** on platforms like Leetcode, SystemDesignInterview.com.  

Would you like me to guide you with a **project-based approach** for learning both HLD & LLD? 🚀
